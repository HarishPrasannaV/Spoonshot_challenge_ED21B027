Pattern :

An element in the output array is generated by multiplying all the elements in the input array,
excluding the one present in the index corresponding to the output element.

Example:

Input : array = [5, 1, 4, 2]
the first element of the output array is generated by multiplying the second, third and the fourth element,
Output[0]= 1*4*2.
similarly, the second element is generated by multiplying the first, third, and the fourth element,
Output[1]= 5*4*2
Output: array = [8,40,10,20]
